In this task, a Solidity smart contract was created to automate the process of joint savings accounts. The contract was designed to accept two user addresses and allow them to control the account by depositing and withdrawing funds. The contract was tested in the Remix IDE's JavaScript VM by compiling and deploying it and then interacting with it using the setAccounts, deposit, and withdraw functions. The execution of each function was confirmed with screenshots saved in an Execution_Results folder. The task was successfully completed, and the fintech startup company can now use this smart contract to automate its financial processes and features.
